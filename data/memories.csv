33	28	6	When I was in K2, we were making apple sauce. The teacher was quite frantic and being the mature 6 year old I was, I decided to help out. After serving everyone else, the teacher ran out of bowls and I patiently waited for mine. When there wasn't a bowl forthcoming, I asked for a bowl. Angrily, the teacher told me to serve myself. I remember being in shock and upset. I was disappointed because I didn't even like the applesauce but got yelled for it. How disappointing. ,,surprise	28	20	female,,
35	28	5	I was maybe 5-6 years old. I was the first child in my family to learn how to shower and wash my hair on my own. It was weird. I thought it to be very natural and everyone was so surprised that I learned how to on my own. I remember feeling pleased. ,,happiness	28	20	female,,

37	32	4	It seems like a lot of my first memories are stories that have been relayed to me through my parents or through pictures, but: I remember walking up to a girl at the aquarium and just kissing her on the cheek. I don't know why; I was apparently a brazen little four year old. But she wasn't upset by it, so I was happy!	Monterey, CA	happiness	32	22	male	Hapa/Multiracial	Stockton, CA
38	38	3	My father had gotten into a serious car accident, and the doctors had told my mother it was a miracle he hadn't died.

39	32	7	My babysitter had gotten in a big fight with her boyfriend, and while my parents were out on the town, he followed her to my house to intimidate her. He knocked on the door, and when he realized that the front door was locked he started banging on the windows and wandering around the house with a broken bottle of some alcohol. I remember her rushing me into the bathroom and telling me that it was bath time, then locking the bathroom door and sitting with me next to the tub while she was on the phone with the police. We waited what seemed like hours for the police to come, my fingers and toes getting pruny.	Stockton, CA	fear	32	22	male	Hapa/Multiracial	Stockton, CA

59	48	5	I was at my friend Nate's house, and he had to use the bathroom, so I just went with him, because we were little and we didn't think it mattered. And then our mothers came and were very alarmed and made me leave the bathroom and told me I shouldn't do that and I was very surprised because I didn't understand what was going on or what was wrong with the situation.

60	48	6	My parents split up when I was 3, and for the first few years my Dad would come to visit with irregular frequency. I never knew when he would come or how long it would be before he'd come back. One of the last times I saw him, before he disappeared from my life for several years, was when I was 5. He came to our apartment and played with my little brother and I. Eventually he got into a fight with my mom, as usually happened, and had to leave. I just remember crying and clinging to his leg and asking him not to go. I was very sad. After he left that time I didn't see him for several years.

61	48	7	I went to a small montessori school where my mother worked until halfway through second grade, when my mom lost her job and my brother and I had to switch to public school. I didn't mind public school, but the first week was a disgusting shock. My fellow second graders insulted each other very graphically all the time. I remember one girl mocking another by saying, 'Oh yeah? Well you had sex with so-and-so!' Even before I knew what sex was I found that kind of disgusting, probably even more so because I didn't understand what it was or what she was talking about or why everyone always seemed to be getting into fights and arguments like that. That was also how I learned about what sex was. 	Hillsborough, NC	disgust	48	18	female	multriracial,

84	62	4	I think that the shape of this memory is colored by my mother's retelling of it, but there were some boys who would make fun of me in K1, and they often infuriated me. One day I came home fuming, saying 'I'm gonna get those boys!' and ranting about how mean they were, and all the bad words they used (ilke 'cornhead'). My memory of this particular event may be a false memory from my mom, but I do remember them bullying (and infuriating) me throughout the year.	my childhood apartment, Boston, MA	anger	62	19	female	white	Boston, MA

On Halloween, we had a special celebration in the cafeteria where each class competed with each other in a series of carnival games. In the final game of Musical Chairs, it was down to me and an older girl. The music stopped and we both went for the chair. I won and she was on the ground. She started to cry but I didn't care. I ran over to my teacher and she hoisted me into the air.	School	happiness	95	21	female,,

146	95	9	I was annoyed at my mom for some reason and it didn't help that she was laughing and poking fun at me. She got out her film camera and started taking snapshots of me looking upset. That put me over the edge so I took the camera and tried to 'remove' the photos by yanking out the film. Of course, as soon as I opened the compartment, the film got exposed to the light. I snapped it shut as fast as I could but the damage had been done. It was my mother's turn being angry because one, there were other pictures on the film, and two, because I wasted the film. She developed it anyway and it turns out that one of the pictures she took of me looking angry came out alright. 	Home	anger	95	21	female,,
147	101	2	I was walking/toddling down the grass next to my driveway to my dad's car, as he had just come home from work. Though I don't associate extreme happiness with the memory, I must have been happy and excited to see my dad because otherwise it is too trivial to remember. I was still in diapers at the time.

153	101	4	I was in preschool, and we were listening to a tape where the music playing indicated how you were supposed to walk in a circle - like tinkly notes for tip toeing, and thunderous sounds for stomping, etc. I tripped and the kids behind me walked ON TOP of me, not around me.
